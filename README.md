# A site to record RxJS usage and learning
This project is to record RxJS usage and sample program of how it interacts, all these shares the same traits other languages; e.g. RxJava, RxScala.
This project is seperated to webpack + typescript compilation and babel only compilation. I prefer the later.

## Installation
1. Install NodeJS.
2. Execute 

```
npm install //yarn init && yarn install
```

2. To run the directly via command line, execute the command.

```
npm run nodeRun
```

3. To run scripts via browser, execute

```
npm run start
```

## Project breakdown
*/src/index.ts* - typescript written codes to test RxJS.
*/src/es6/exec.js* - works like playground, supports es6.

## Lesson learned
1. Prototypal in typescript is not supported. Workaround ? Not available for typescript 3.
2. Library to vast, similar to lodash, good luck to find what's needed.
